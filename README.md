# KanjiBezierPaths
Small realm database with all kanji strokes data.

## Dependency

- Realm

## Usage

```
let provider = KanjiProvider()
guard let bezierPaths: [UIBezierPath] = provider.pathesForKanji("æ•°")
debugPrint(bezierPaths.count)
```

You can then use the array of bezierPaths to draw kanji or to do whatever you like with it.

## Origin

All data comes from this repo https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg.
Long ago I extracted strokes info from svgs inside this repo, and stored them as binary files with array of UIBezierPath encoded to blob. Then I wrote a small python script which stored all this data into small sqlite database. And now since I use Realm in projects which potentially will use this framework, I generated Realm database from that old sqlite db.
